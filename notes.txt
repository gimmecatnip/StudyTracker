Get inputs to post to the database. - Done
Create the NAV Bar.  NAV bar items should bring user to an input screen

Create Daily dashboard page.

1. Clicking on "Daily" NavBar should bring up an input of parameters screen
 (perhaps a popup?).  Done.  But the date I input doesn't do anything yet.  
 2. Add form to accept the date wanted.  Done
 3. Submission of form should render a new EJS page with Daily Analysis for 
    day selected.  Renders the Daily Analysis page and data format, 
    but needs to take into consideration the date input and render that specific information.  
    Might need to reassess what the monthly and annual figures are to do on this screen.  
4.  Add a "Home" navigation link onto the page.

                    <%= items.item %>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <%= items.minutes %>
                </li>
                <% }) %>
        </ul>
