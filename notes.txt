Defects/Issues:
Home Page: Controls to the "Add" button.  Make it so you can't double click (add twice).  
Reset the input fields to empty.
Daily Analysis - each day shows up as the prior day.  1st day shows as prior month.  
Is it just the display name?
I think I fixed this by adding 5 hours to the adjustedInputeDate instead of just 4 hours. 

Daily Analysis Results:  Correct data.  Date displayed is the prior date.  Fixed, see above.
Weekly Analysis Page: Dates displayed are correct.  Data chops off the first day 
    data, adds the next day data(the 8th day).  Try adjusting the input date by 5 hours.
    instead of 4. Fixed!
Monthly Analysis Page:  January Data is in.  Date displays correctly.  Similar issues.  
    When choosing 1/1/23, returns 1/1/23 data only, and displays December 2022 title. 
    When choosing mid-month date, returns January data minus 1/1/23 and plus 2/1/23 data. 
     




Crashes when there is no data.  Needs to be able to handle empty data sets.
